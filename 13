# Generate a list of random numbers from normal distribution
random_numbers <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)  # Generates 100 random numbers with mean 0 and standard deviation 1

# Count occurrences of each value
occurrences <- table(round(random_numbers, digits = 2))  # Round to 2 decimal places for better counting accuracy

# Print occurrences of each value
print(occurrences)
